# Covid19_peak_predictor
This is a Neural Network based prediction analysis on the covid-19 dataset as to when different countries will hit their peak
Let's visualize how the cases around the world have increased. We can see that China seems to have flattened the curved, Italy had hit its peak but US,India still has more day before peaking.

India
This is based on data until June 13, 2020.
India should peak when it will have around 630,000 cases as seen by this model.
In this model, I am using Multi-layer Perceptron regressor to predict the data. The peak day and numbers is found by fitting the log curve.
